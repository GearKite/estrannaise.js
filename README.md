# estrannaise.js
estrannaise.js is a small playground for estradiol pharmacokinetics. It can simulate estradiol blood levels under arbitrary dosing regimes and schedules. In the near future it will allow users to infer model parameters from outside sources, including their personal blood levels.

Under the hood, estrannaise.js uses pharmacokinetic compartments models together with MCMC inference using either a flat Gaussian model or our very own homebrewed hierarchical Bayesian amodel called Emix.

**estrannaise.js is entirely client-side. Your data, whether entered, imported, or stashed, remains exclusively within your browser and will never be transmitted to the developer(s) or any third-party.**

# TODO
- Double click add to guess values of next row (same dose, next time from last two times)
- Add emix model of interstudy variability
- Handle mixed days/dates. If one or more dates are present in the day column days assume offsets are in relation to the earliest date
- Enable/disable individual doses, if disabled then u visibility checkbox is disabled as well
- Figure out the behavior when deleting first multi-dose row. Previous item should automatically take care of it
- Add sublingual/buccal model (2C model?)
- Add patch model (3C model followed by glued 2C model if removal time specified)
- Add oral model (4C compartment with combined E1+E1S C's, or 5C with separate E1 and E1S C's)
